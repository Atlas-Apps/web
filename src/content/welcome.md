## Game Plan

> Here's the pipeline. I'm working hard to get these apps out as quickly as possible without compromising quality.

1. **Speed Blackjack** is the highest priority and hopefully the most useful. Online gambling is on the rise. In 2019, the global online gambling market size was $57.9 billion and is on track to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.5% from 2020-2017 [1]. Casino games, like blackjack, make up a significant portion of the industry. **Speed Blackjack** fills the needs for a solid combination between fun and learning. Through practice, **Speed Blackjack** players can learn basic strategy, common player mistakes, and have a little fun before risking a dime with the heavy hitters.
    
    <br/>As the name implies, **Speed Blackjack** does away with the slow animations and gimics of competing blackjack apps helping you learn more, quicker. **Speed Blackjack** is almost ready for release. Stay tunned.

2. **Color Wheel** is an app made for artists and color enthusiast. Quickly find complementary color with this simple, easy to use color wheel. Save your favorite colors for later. Coming soon.
